## Known Limitations / Deferred Non-Goals

### Current Limitations

1. **No npm registry publishing**
   - Release workflow only creates GitHub Releases
   - No automated npm package publishing configured
   - **Rationale**: Task requirement was GitHub Releases first; npm publish is optional extension

2. **CODEOWNERS is commented out**
   - Placeholder structure exists but no active maintainers defined
   - **Rationale**: Maintainer identities not yet established; ready for activation when defined

3. **No package versions in workspace packages**
   - Individual packages (machina-cli, machina-plugin, machina-shared, machina-web) are private with no version fields
   - **Rationale**: Workspace uses `workspace:*` protocol; versions sync from git tags at release time

4. **No release-please automation of version bumps**
   - Config exists but no automated PR workflow for version bumping
   - **Rationale**: Manual version bump procedure documented in RELEASE.md; automation can be added later

5. **No CHANGELOG.md**
   - Release-please config references CHANGELOG.md but file not created
   - **Rationale**: Changelog generation via release-please; file will be auto-generated on first release

### Deferred Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Cross-repo release orchestration**
   - No coordination with external repositories
   - **Rationale**: Task explicitly excluded cross-repo orchestration

2. **Automated semantic version inference**
   - Version bumps require manual decision (patch/minor/major)
   - **Rationale**: Deterministic manual process aligns with RELEASE.md procedures

3. **Pre-release environment testing**
   - Beta release procedure references staging environment testing but no automated staging configured
   - **Rationale**: Infrastructure setup deferred; manual testing documented as requirement

4. **Performance regression testing**
   - Beta-specific gates mention performance checks but no automated benchmarking
   - **Rationale**: Infrastructure setup deferred; manual testing documented as requirement

## Release Recommendation

### Decision: ✅ **GO**

OpenCode Machina is **READY FOR PUBLIC RELEASE** per the following assessment:

#### Compliance Summary

| Category | Required Tasks | Completed | Status |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Governance | Task 1 | 1/1 | ✅ PASS |
| Documentation | Tasks 2-3 | 2/2 | ✅ PASS |
| Automation | Tasks 4-6 | 3/3 | ✅ PASS |
| Operations | Task 7 | 1/1 | ✅ PASS |
| Reporting | Task 8 | 1/1 | ✅ PASS |
| **TOTAL** | **8** | **8** | **✅ PASS** |

#### Justification

1. **All required governance tasks completed**: Tasks 1-7 verified with evidence logs and notepad documentation
2. **Workspace gates pass live verification**: typecheck, test, build all succeed
3. **Documentation is production-ready**: No TODO placeholders; all required sections present
4. **Release procedures are deterministic**: Clear step-by-step procedures for stable, beta, hotfix, and rollback
5. **Automation is configured**: CI gates and release workflow are operational
6. **Limitations are documented and acceptable**: No blockers identified; deferred items are non-goals per task requirements

#### Recommendations for First Release

1. **Initial release strategy**: Start with beta release (`v0.1.0-beta.1`) to validate release workflow
2. **CODEOWNERS activation**: Assign maintainers and uncomment CODEOWNERS file before stable release
3. **CHANGELOG generation**: First automated release will generate CHANGELOG.md via release-please
4. **Documentation validation**: Test README.md installation instructions in fresh environment
5. **Community channels**: Prepare GitHub Discussions and issue triage procedures

#### Minimum Next Steps to Reach GO (IF NO-GO)

**N/A - Already at GO**
