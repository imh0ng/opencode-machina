# OpenCode Machina 🤖

OpenCode Machina is a production-grade OpenCode plugin built on oh-my-opencode, delivering comprehensive capabilities with a custom neon-mint themed interface.

## Overview

Machina combines the power of oh-my-opencode's multi-agent framework with a comprehensive feature set, featuring:

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**: Built on oh-my-opencode for collaborative agent workflows
- **🚀 Full-Stack Terminal Control**: Complete system-level permissions and capabilities
- **🎨 Custom UI**: Neon mint themed dark/light mode interface with custom web UI
- **📦 Production Ready**: Comprehensive release governance with stable and beta channels
- **🔌 OpenCode Integration**: Seamless plugin experience within the OpenCode ecosystem

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** 1.0 or later: [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **OpenCode** with oh-my-opencode plugin installed
- **Git** for version management

### From Git Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/code-yeongyu/opencode-machina.git
cd opencode-machina

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build all packages
bun run build
```

### Integration with OpenCode

Machina is designed as an OpenCode plugin. After building:

1. Install the plugin package to your OpenCode configuration
2. Configure oh-my-opencode to load Machina agents
3. Start OpenCode with the plugin enabled

```bash
# Run the Machina CLI
bun run run
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that all packages build correctly
bun run build

# Verify types
bun run typecheck

# Run tests
bun test
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

Machina provides a unified CLI interface through `bun run run`:

```bash
# Main entry point
bun run run

# View help and available commands
bun run run --help
```

### Build Scripts

The project uses a monorepo structure with multiple packages:

```bash
# Build all packages
bun run build

# Type check all packages
bun run typecheck

# Run all tests
bun test

# Individual package builds (if needed)
bun --cwd=packages/machina-shared run build
bun --cwd=packages/machina-plugin run build
bun --cwd=packages/machina-cli run build
```

### Web Interface

Machina includes a local web UI with:

- **Dark mode** (default) with neon mint accents
- **Light mode** toggle support
- Real-time agent activity monitoring
- Terminal integration and output streaming

Access the web UI by starting the OpenCode extension and navigating to the Machina panel.

| Channel | Branch | Stability | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Stable** | `main` | Production-grade | Production deployments |
| **Beta** | `beta` | Pre-production | Pre-release testing |

### Version Tags

- **Stable**: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Beta**: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta.1`)
- **Hotfix**: `vX.Y.Z` (patch increment, e.g., `v1.0.1`)

### Choosing a Version

- Use **stable** (`main` branch) for production
- Use **beta** (`beta` branch) for testing new features
- Beta releases may have bugs and breaking changes
- Report beta issues to help improve stability

See [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) for detailed release procedures.

## Releasing

### Release Requirements

Before creating any release:

1. ✅ All tests pass (`bun test`)
2. ✅ Type checking passes (`bun run typecheck`)
3. ✅ Clean build succeeds (`bun run build`)
4. ✅ Version consistency across all packages
5. ✅ Release notes prepared
6. ✅ Documentation updated

### Stable Release

```bash
# Ensure on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update version numbers
bun run version:patch  # or minor/major

# Commit version bump
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"

# Push commit and tag
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# Create GitHub Release
gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes
```

### Beta Release

```bash
# Ensure on beta branch
git checkout beta
git pull origin beta

# Update version with beta suffix
bun run version:prerelease beta

# Commit version bump
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z-beta.N"

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z-beta.N -m "Beta vX.Y.Z-beta.N"

# Push commit and tag
git push origin beta
git push origin vX.Y.Z-beta.N

# Create GitHub Release (pre-release)
gh release create vX.Y.Z-beta.N --prerelease --generate-notes
```
